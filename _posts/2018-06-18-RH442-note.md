#> 1. Edit the cron definition that collects sar data to run sa1 every minute.
vi /etc/cron.d/sysstat
head -n 2 /etc/cron.d/sysstat
## Run system activity accounting tool every 10 minutes
# * * * * * root /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 1 1

#> 2. Run lab graphing setup
lab graphing setup

#> 3. 4. 5. 6. see 'learning practice'

#> 7. Install Performance Co-Pilot. (pcp)
yum -y install pcp-gui

#> 8. Start Performance Co-Pilot.
service pcp start;
chkconfig pcp on;
service pcp status;

#> 9. Capture 10 samples of the mem.util.used metric from Performance Co-Pilot.
pmval -s 10 mem.util.used > /tmp/pcp-mem.util.used.data

#> 10.  Create a view using pmchart that includes the following charts: mem.util.used, disk.all.aveq, and proc.nprocs.
pmchart &

Click the New Chart button. On the Metrics tab, select mem > util > used. Click OK.
Click the New Chart button. On the Metrics tab, select disk > all > aveq. Click OK.
Click the New Chart button. On the Metrics tab, select proc > nprocs. Click OK.

#> 11.  Save your chart as graphtest.
Open the File menu, select Save View ... On the resulting dialog window, in the Filename: field, enter graphtest. Click Save.

#> 12. Download the sampleserver.tgz
wget http://content.example.com/courses/rh442/rhel7.0/materials/sampleserver.tgz
tar -xf sampleserver.tgz
# Determine the parameter which would provide the one-minute load average.
pminfo | grep load
pminfo -t kernel.all.load
# Determine the highest one-minute load average experienced.
pmval -a sampleserver.log/20150223.12.24.0 kernel.all.load | tail -n +11 | awk '{print $2}' | sort -rn | head -n 5
# Determine the first time that the one-minute load average reached 19.12.
pmval -a sampleserver.log/20150223.12.24.0 kernel.all.load | grep 19\.12 | head -n 1

### GENERAL TUNING
```
The Linux kernel exposes information and tunables to user space through the /proc directory.
/proc is a user space-accessible area of kernel memory attached into the file system. 
/proc holds information about the system, as seen by the kernel, such as:
- /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/swaps, /proc/<PID>, /proc/sys

Userspace utilities often use the data in /proc to gather the information they display. For
example, the uptime command gathers its data from /proc/uptime and /proc/loadavg.
Sometimes the data in /proc is used directly, like with /proc/loadavg, though sometimes the
user space utility needs to do some additional processing to convert the data into human-friendly
format, as with /proc/uptime.

One of the directories in /proc, /proc/sys, shows data relating to how the kernel handles
many low-level operating system activities, but unlike most of the files in /proc, files in
/proc/sys are generally writable by root. Through making changes to files in /proc/sys, 
administrators can make changes to their running Linux kernel to change its behavior. This is
an incredibly powerful feature offered by the Linux kernel.
